# Admin API Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for all admin-level API endpoints in the MMV Freelance Platform.

## 📋 Documentation Overview

The admin API endpoints provide super administrators with full control over user management, including:

- **User Retrieval**: Get individual users and user profiles
- **User Management**: Create, update, and delete users
- **User Moderation**: Ban and unban users
- **Role Management**: Assign, remove, and view user roles and permissions
- **Bulk Operations**: List all users with pagination and filtering

## 🔐 Authorization

All endpoints in this documentation require **SUPER_ADMIN** role authorization. Access is controlled through JWT token authentication with role-based access control (RBAC).

## 🧪 Testing

Each endpoint has been thoroughly tested with comprehensive test scripts covering:
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and error handling
- Business logic validation
- Edge cases and error scenarios

## 💻 Frontend Integration

Each documentation file includes complete frontend implementation examples in:
- **JavaScript** (Vanilla)
- **React** (Hooks)
- **Vue.js** (Composition API)
- **Angular** (Services & Components)

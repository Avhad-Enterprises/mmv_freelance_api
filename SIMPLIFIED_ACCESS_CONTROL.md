# Simplified Access Control - Role-Based Only

## Overview
The access control system has been simplified to use **ROLE-BASED ONLY** authentication, removing permission-based checks for easier developer understanding.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Permission Middleware
- Commented out all `requirePermission()` calls in routes
- Kept permission system in database for future use
- Only using `requireRole()` middleware for access control

### 2. Simplified Role Hierarchy

#### SUPER_ADMIN
- **Full Access**: Can do everything on the platform
- **User Management**: Create, read, update, delete all users
- **Role Management**: Assign/remove roles from users  
- **System Management**: Create/update roles and permissions

#### ADMIN
- **Limited Admin Access**: View and manage users (except role assignment)
- **User Moderation**: Ban/unban users, view user profiles
- **Content Management**: Access admin functions but cannot modify roles

#### Regular Users (CLIENT, VIDEOGRAPHER, VIDEO_EDITOR)
- **Own Profile**: Can update their own profile and account
- **Standard Access**: Regular platform features based on user type

### 3. Updated Route Protection

#### User Management Routes
```
GET    /users              → SUPER_ADMIN only
POST   /users              → SUPER_ADMIN only  
PUT    /users/:id          → SUPER_ADMIN only
DELETE /users/:id          → SUPER_ADMIN only
GET    /users/:id          → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
POST   /users/:id/ban      → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
POST   /users/:id/unban    → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
```

#### Role Management Routes
```
GET    /users/:id/roles        → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
POST   /users/:id/roles        → SUPER_ADMIN only
DELETE /users/:id/roles/:roleId → SUPER_ADMIN only
GET    /users/:id/permissions  → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
```

#### System Management Routes
```
GET    /role/getrole           → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
POST   /role/insertrole        → SUPER_ADMIN only
PUT    /role/updaterole/:id    → SUPER_ADMIN only
GET    /permission/getpermission → ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
POST   /permission/insertpermission → SUPER_ADMIN only
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Simplicity**
- Developers only need to understand 5 roles instead of 100+ permissions
- Clear hierarchy: SUPER_ADMIN > ADMIN > Regular Users
- Easier to debug and troubleshoot access issues

### 2. **Faster Development**
- No need to assign specific permissions to roles
- Role assignment automatically grants appropriate access
- Less configuration needed for new features

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Permission system remains in database for future enhancement
- Can easily re-enable permissions if needed later
- Cleaner codebase with fewer middleware layers

## Role Access Summary

| Action | SUPER_ADMIN | ADMIN | Users |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Create Users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Users | ✅ | ✅ | Own Only |
| Ban Users | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Assign Roles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage Roles/Permissions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Update Own Profile | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Testing the Changes

### 1. Super Admin Access (Full)
```bash
# Login as Super Admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "superadmin@mmv.com", "password": "SuperAdmin123!"}'

# Test creating user (should work)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first_name": "Test", "last_name": "User", "email": "test@mmv.com", "roleName": "CLIENT"}'
```

### 2. Admin Access (Limited)
```bash
# Login as Admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "testadmin@mmv.com", "password": "TestPass123!"}'

# Test viewing users (should work)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/79 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Test creating user (should fail - 403 Forbidden)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first_name": "Test", "last_name": "User", "email": "test2@mmv.com"}'
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/features/user/user.routes.ts`** - Removed all permission checks
2. **`src/features/role/role.routes.ts`** - Added role-based protection
3. **`src/features/permission/permission.routes.ts`** - Added role-based protection

## Future Enhancement

The permission system remains intact in the database and can be re-enabled by:
1. Uncommenting `requirePermission()` calls
2. Importing permission middleware
3. Adding more granular access control as needed

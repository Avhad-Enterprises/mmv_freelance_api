## 🎯 Next Steps (Remaining Work)

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation** ⏳ NOT STARTED

This is the logical next phase according to the original plan. We need to test everything we've built.

#### **Step 4.1: Unit Testing**
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test auth service (registration, login, JWT)
- [ ] Test user service (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Test type-specific services (client, videographer, videoeditor)
- [ ] Test RBAC middleware (role and permission checking)
- [ ] Test profile loader utility
- [ ] Test validation DTOs

**Tools:**
- Jest or Mocha
- Supertest for API testing

---

#### **Step 4.2: Integration Testing**
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test complete registration flows
  - Client registration → role assignment → profile creation
  - Videographer registration → role assignment → freelancer profile + videographer profile
  - Video editor registration → role assignment → freelancer profile + videoeditor profile
- [ ] Test login flow → JWT generation → authenticated requests
- [ ] Test profile updates (user fields vs profile fields)
- [ ] Test password reset flow
- [ ] Test RBAC access control
  - Client can only access client routes
  - Videographer can only access videographer routes
  - Admin can access admin routes
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test delete operations (cascade verification)

**Test Cases:**
- Happy paths (successful operations)
- Error cases (invalid input, unauthorized access, not found)
- Edge cases (missing fields, invalid roles, etc.)

- [ ] Test rollback procedures

**Migration Logic:**
```sql
-- Example: Migrate clients
INSERT INTO client_profiles (user_id, company_name, industry, ...)
SELECT user_id, company_name, industry, ...
FROM users_old
WHERE account_type = 'client';

-- Assign CLIENT role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id)
SELECT user_id, (SELECT role_id FROM role WHERE name = 'CLIENT')
FROM users_old
WHERE account_type = 'client';
```

---

### **Phase 7: Remaining Features** ⏳ PENDING

## 🎯 Recommended Next Step

### **Start Phase 4: Testing & Validation**

**Why?**
1. We've built a complete backend system but haven't tested it end-to-end
2. Testing will reveal any bugs or issues before frontend integration
3. Unit tests ensure code quality and prevent regressions
4. Integration tests verify the entire flow works correctly

**Priority Order:**
1. **HIGH:** API Endpoint Testing (Step 4.3)
   - Create Postman collection
   - Test all 52 endpoints manually
   - Document request/response examples
   
2. **HIGH:** Integration Testing (Step 4.2)
   - Test registration flows
   - Test RBAC access control
   - Test profile updates
   
3. **MEDIUM:** Unit Testing (Step 4.1)
   - Write automated tests for services
   - Write tests for middleware
   
4. **MEDIUM:** Frontend Integration Planning (Phase 5)
   - Document breaking changes
   - Create migration guide
